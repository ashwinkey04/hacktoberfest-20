4. Open the cloned directory using your system's file manager. You must see two files namely **AWESOME.md** and **README.md**
5. Open AWESOME.md using your favorite text editor and add your name to a new line at the bottom of the file in this format. Feel free to add your favorite emoji with the help of markdown emojis [here](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908)
